Is it really day 2 or did you just keep reading after the day 1 stuff? You just kept reading didn't you? It's cool, do this at your own pace. You are a champion.

### Day 2

Let's go find some stuff to look at! 

There are a bunch of communities in the "fediverse". Not all of them are even Mastodon servers. There are instagram, tiktok, and reddit like things in this place and you can follow some of those as well, but that is something else. 

Let's go back to hash tags. Whatever app you are using there is probably a search somewhere on it and so pop in there and look for "intro" then click on the "hashtags" tab (if you have one) you should see a bunch of new people or old people reintroducing themselves. You can then also follow or block a tag depending on what you want. For example, you may want to follow #art, but block #modernArt. This will mean anytime someone uses the tag #art you will see it, unless they also use a #modernArt tag in which case it won't show up in your feed.

If you are looking for people to follow specifically [fedi.directory](https://fedi.directory/) is pretty good. I do recommending following a lot of people. You can always pare down later, but not everyone posts everyday so having some extra info isn't the worst. You can also just skulk around for a while and find people through other peoples follows. I ain't here to tell you what to do I just want you to be happy.

Now go burn an hour goofing around and staring at peoples profiles!
