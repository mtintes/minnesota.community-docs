## Day 1

Ok, so maybe you were on a different platform or maybe you weren't either way this place is a maze. This is my dumb general guide, but https://fedi.tips has all this same info plus more and is searchable.

Mastodon is generally built the same way as other social media platforms, but it's also a lot different. If you just created your account you won't really see anything, that is because you are in control of what you see. We have no algorithm, there is no bot. It is also because the instance you are now on is part of a much bigger ecosystem and to save resources the server doesn't just slurp everything in. It will only track data for stuff other people on the server care about. If there is only a single person then you will really only see their feed worth of stuff happening.

Hopefully that makes sense so far. You will find new people to follow and we will get to that in a minute. Mastodon is for the most part welcoming and unlike other social media there tends to not be a villian of the day. I find people here have actual conversations or at least are more about having conversations. It is not a popularity contest as much as a hangout, IMHO. 

So let's get you some new friends! If you don't know anyone post a #intro toot (yes they are called toots, move past it). Hobbies, Interests, maybe why you are here, that sort of thing. USE #HASHTAGS. It's how you find new people and how people find you. For the intro post use '#intro'. Also if you have a multi word hashtag it is recommended to do Pascal case so #ThisIsFourWords. It helps people that use text-to-audio software read hashtags easier. I've heard conflicting reports between whether the first word needs to be upper or lowercase so err-ing on the side of more likely to work here.

After you've done your first toot, (again sorry but I can't change it) you'll want to go to your profile and start updating it. Again, #hashtags and intro stuff can help people know what you are about. Lot's of people look at that profile and so it is important. You don't need a pic of you or whatever and if you are a lurker then also welcome and you don't have to do any of this. You can also lock your account and that requires approval for people to follow you.

We do not have verification here at least not in the give a billionaire money and they will approve you somehow sense. If you want to verify yourself you can link your websites, other profiles (github), or anything that will allow you to add references to your mastodon profile. Go [here](https://fedi.tips/how-do-i-verify-my-account/)for more info if you want to verify your account.

Ok, that is day one, you did a ton of work. Go take a nap or something.
